# Quickstart
```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry shell
scrapy crawl playdede -O data.json
```
NOTE: This project was only tested on Python 3.8, but should work with any version of Python 3.

# IDE
For Python there are several good IDEs, but my recommendation is PyCharm:

# Scrapy's Documentation
We use [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) to crawl and scrape playdede, you can find [here](https://docs.scrapy.org/) the official documentation (it's pretty good)
I recommend reading the official documentation, but before that you could check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp6LRijW9wg&t=10s) YouTube video, which offers a nice introduction to Scrapy.

# Other
[This](https://toscrape.com/) web is good to practice scraping, if you need to.
